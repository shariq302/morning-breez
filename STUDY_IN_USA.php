                                        selection criteria. American Universities are definitely melting pots of diverse
                                        cultures, with the spectrum spread over more than 60 countries. At present there
                                        are almost 10,00,000 international students studying in different universities
                                        in U.S apart from about 160,000 Indian students. American degrees are highly
                                        regarded world over and give a cutting edge advantage to an individual while
                                        applying for a job.</p>

                                    <p>Climate varies considerably across the United States. You will probably need an
                                        umbrella, even in Las Vegas or Los Angeles. In the northern cities you will need
                                        cold weather and snow gear. In the southern states, summers may be very hot and
                                        the winters mild. Depending on the part of the country, temperatures during the
                                        summer will run from the 70s through the 90s..</p>

                                    <p>Once you enrolled in the campus, there will be “The International Student
                                        Orientation Program,” coordinated by the Admissions Office or the Office of
                                        International Programs. Information on many topics like immigration, academic
                                        advisors, computer and library resources, telephone services, public safety,
                                        medical services, banking and transportation options will be provided through

                                    <p>There are many transportation options for getting around in your new country. A

                                        traveling in the USA. They are slightly more expensive than traveling by bus,
                                        but it is much quicker. Taxis can be extremely expensive for students.</p>

                                        sciences or technical fields. American colleges and universities offer three

                                    recommended that You apply as early as possible. Applications can be initiated
                                    during final year/semester study of your course (students pursuing BSc/B.com can

                                <br><h4>VISA PROCESS</h4><br>

                                <p>There are several immigrant and non-immigrant visa options at USA and one has to
                                    choose the one that is applicable according to the requirements. The passport
                                    must be valid for at least six months beyond the end of your intended stay in
                                    the US. Immigration regulations are very strict with respect to working while
                                    carrying a student visa. F-1 status, which is the most common status for
                                    full-time international students, allows for part time, on-campus employment
                                    (fewer than 20 hours per week.) J-1 student status allows for similar
                                    employment, with similar restrictions, as long as permission is given by the
                                    exchange visitor program sponsor. M-1 visa holders for technical and vocational
                                    programs are not permitted to work during the course of their studies.</p>

                                <p>To get the F-1 visa approved, the student will need to show that he/she has
                                    sufficient funds to pay for the first year of study and that you have resources
                                    available to cover the rest of your educational program. For an M-1 or J-1 visa,
                                    you will need to convince the authorities that you have sufficient funds to pay
                                    for all tuition and living costs for your complete stay in the US.</p>
                                <br> <h4>WORK OPPORTUNITIES</h4><br>


                                <p>Students are permitted to work 20 hours per week on-campus during the
                                    first years of study. In the second year students are allowed to take
                                    part-time jobs or co-op/internships off campus to fulfill academic or
                                    financial requirements. The on campus jobs do not pay much and certainly
                                    not enough to finance a university education. This kind of jobs can only
                                    be a supplement to other funds.</p>

                                <p>Along with the acceptability and recognition of education, USA also
                                    offers the best in terms of future job prospects and immigration
                                    possibilities after studies. All students are entitled to stay back and
                                    work for one year period in USA under OPT (Optional Professional
                                    Training). For STEM Graduates(Science, Technology, Engineering and
                                    Mathematics) the OPT can be further extended to another 24 months (Total
                                    36 Months). Students who are successful in finding a suitable placement
                                    can apply for H1B (Job Visa) during this period.</p><br>

                                    There are few universities which accept 3 year degree students for

                                    There are number of programs and good universities in which you can
                                    get admission with your GRE/GMAT or SAT

                                    There are ‘Pathway’ programs which give you conditional admissions
                                    to Tier 1 universities with comparatively low academics and test
                                    scores

                                    are
                                    literally hundreds of public and private higher education establishments
