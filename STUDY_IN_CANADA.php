                                    <p>IELTS or TOEFL or PTE is mandatory admission requirement for all New Zealand
                                        courses. Majority of the Bachelors degrees and Post Graduate courses require
                                        overall 6.5 (with individual band of 6). Overall 6 and individual band score of
                                        5.5 are accepted for level 6 and 7 diploma courses. For postgraduate programs,
                                        most of the good universities ask for a first class or high second class. In the
                                        undergraduate level most of the good universities look for a 70 % or higher. But
                                        in private independent colleges, there are no such rigid mark restrictions and
                                        any degree would be accepted. There are cases where significant work experience
                                        is considering lieu to a Bachelor’s degree</p>
