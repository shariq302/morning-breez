                                    <p>New Zealand’s pristine landscape provides the backdrop for some extreme outdoor
                                        activities. From mountain climbing to the thrill of bungy jumping, skydiving and
                                        white-water rafting, New Zealand is the home for lovers of the great outdoors.
                                        New Zealand qualifications are recognised and highly valued by industry and
                                        community leaders all over the world.New Zealand has an excellent
                                        centrally-managed quality assurance system, the New Zealand Qualifications
                                        Authority (NZQA), which requires that all institutions enrolling international
                                        students be registered and ensures compliance with qualifications standards. A
                                        fresh outlook generates fresh ideas. A youthful nation, New Zealand has forged
                                        ahead in developing its own ‘kiwi’ identity and innovative ways of thinking.</p>
                                    <br><h4>EDUCATION SYSTEMS</h4><br>

                                    <p>New Zealand’s education is based on the British system and, hence, is recognised
                                        worldwide. New Zealand’s government directly controls and finances the country’s
                                        20 polytechnics and eight universities. This ensures compliance with state
                                        standards.New Zealand has a high professional standards, a supportive learning
                                        environment, and a focus on student welfare. The New Zealand Code of Practice
                                        for the Pastoral Care of International Students sets out the minimum standards
                                        for the care and support of international students during their studies in New
                                        Zealand.</p>
                                    <br><h4>COURSES AND UNIVERSITIES</h4><br>

                                    <p>New Zealand has eight state-funded universities, 16 Institutes of Technology and
                                        Polytechnics (ITPs) and about 550 Private Training Establishments (PTEs), which
                                        include English language schools.</p>

                                    <p>Choose the type of institution that’s best for your career path:</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Universities offer higher degree-level education. Programmes are
                                        research-led and generally academic rather than vocational. In the 2015/16
                                        QS World University Rankings, all eight of New Zealand’s universities were
                                        in the top 100 in at least one subject.
                                        ITPs and a few larger PTEs offer vocational degree-level education .PTEs
                                        tend to offer specific vocational programmes, mainly at certificate and
                                        diploma level. </p>

                                    <br><h4>ELIGIBILITY TEST REQUIREMENTS</h4><br>

                                    <p>IELTS or TOEFL or PTE is mandatory admission requirement for all New
                                        Zealand courses.</p>

                                    <p>Majority of the Bachelors degrees and Post Graduate courses require
                                        overall 6.5 (with individual band of 6). Overall 6 and individual band
                                        score of 5.5 are accepted for level 6 and 7 diploma courses.For
                                        postgraduate programs, most of the good universities ask for a first
                                        class or high second class. In the undergraduate level most of the good
                                        universities look for a 70 % or higher. But in private independent
                                        colleges, there are no such rigid mark restrictions and any degree would
                                        be accepted. There are cases where significant work experience is
                                        considering lieu to a Bachelor’s degree</p><br>
